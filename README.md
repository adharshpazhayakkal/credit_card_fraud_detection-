Credit card fraud detection 
Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue affecting financial institutions and cardholders worldwide, leading to substantial financial losses and potential harm. To combat this, advanced technologies such as machine learning are employed to develop robust fraud detection systems.

This dataset provides a simulated collection of credit card transactions, encompassing both genuine and fraudulent activities. It serves as a resource for developing and testing fraud detection algorithms and systems.
