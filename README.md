Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry to prevent financial losses and maintain customer trust. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of approximately 1.3 million transactions over a two-year period.

Motivation

With the increasing prevalence of digital transactions, the risk of credit card fraud has grown significantly. This project aims to develop an effective fraud detection system to minimize financial losses and enhance security for customers and businesses.

Goals

Develop a robust fraud detection model: Utilize machine learning algorithms to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

Understand patterns in fraudulent activities: Perform extensive data analysis to uncover trends and insights.

Improve detection accuracy: Implement various techniques to enhance the model's performance.

Provide actionable recommendations: Suggest strategies to further mitigate fraud risks.

Dataset Overview

Total Transactions: 1,296,675

Fraudulent Transactions: 7,506 (0.58%)

Time Range: January 1, 2019, to June 21, 2020

Gender Distribution: 54.7% Female, 45.3% Male

Transaction Amount Range: $1 to $28,948.90

Number of Merchants: 693

Number of Cities: 894

Number of States: 21

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from the EDA include:

Fraudulent transactions are more common in categories like 'Shopping_net', 'Grocery_pos', and 'misc_net'.

Normal transactions peak on Mondays and Sundays, while fraudulent transactions are more evenly spread throughout the week.

There are no significant correlations between most variables and fraud, highlighting the need for advanced modeling techniques.


Models and Performance

Several machine learning models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. The performance metrics for these models are as follows:

Random Forest

Accuracy: 99.78%

Precision: 94%

Recall: 75%

F1-Score: 82.74%

Other Models
Logistic Regression: Lower accuracy and recall compared to Random Forest.

XGBoost: Comparable accuracy but higher complexity.

Decision Tree: Simpler model with lower accuracy.

Feature Importance
The following features were identified as most significant in detecting fraud:


log_amt: Logarithm of transaction amount

category_grocery_pos: Category indicating grocery point-of-sale transactions

category_misc_net: Category indicating miscellaneous net transactions

category_shopping_net: Category indicating shopping net transactions

category_travel: Category indicating travel-related transactions

Improvements for Future Work
To further enhance fraud detection, consider implementing the following changes:


Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.

Anomaly Detection: Use advanced techniques like Autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection.

Real-Time Detection: Develop a system for real-time fraud detection to prevent fraudulent transactions before they are completed.

Biometric Confirmation: Implement fingerprint or iris recognition for additional security layers.

Two-Step Verification: Combine traditional authentication methods with biometric verification for enhanced security, especially for vulnerable customer groups.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting credit card fraud. By leveraging advanced models and thorough data analysis, we can significantly reduce the risk of fraud and protect financial assets. Continuous improvement and the implementation of new technologies will further strengthen fraud prevention measures.
